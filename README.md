# Node.js Assignments

This repository contains weekly assignments for learning Node.js.

## ðŸ“š Weeks
- [Week 1](./Week-1): Set up Node.js and create your first application

- [Week 2](./Week-2): Utilize Node.js core modules such as File System, Path, and HTTP to create a simple file management tool that can create, read, and delete files.

- [Week 3](./Week-3): convert callback-based code to Promises and Async/Await.
Refactor an existing piece of code that uses callbacks for async operations to use Promises and Async/Await for better readability and error handling.
- - The callback-based function fetchUserFromDB was using setTimeout to simulate a database fetch and handled errors via callback parameters. In the refactored version, the function returns a Promise, and the asynchronous call is handled using async/await, making the code more readable and maintainable, and separating error handling using try...catch.

- [Week 4](./Week-4): Set up a simple web server using Express.js that can handle basic routing and middleware. Implement routes to respond to at least two different endpoints.

- [Week 5](./Week-5/): Develop a simple application to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) entries in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
